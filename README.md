## "The Archiving Website of 'Over the Rainbow'"

This work beautifully portrays a day in the life of a dog crossing the Rainbow Bridge, along with his friends. Instead of treating death with heaviness, it fills the narrative with joy and warmth, offering comfort to those suffering from 'pet loss syndrome.' It encourages reminiscence of the precious moments spent with beloved pets, serving as a heartfelt reminder of shared happiness and providing true solace during times of emotional turmoil.

Additionally, this website archives the heartfelt letters written by readers of the book, dedicated to their beloved pets. These messages, full of love and memories, offer a space for owners to express their feelings and keep their cherished moments alive, creating a lasting tribute to the bond shared with their pets.
